                        I'm a personality that very easily comes into contact with other people.
                        I tend to permanently help someone who needs me. I really like to sleep and eat ice cream.
                         I always get pleasure when someone falls to me for unexpected gifts.</p>

                        As I have already mentioned, I love to learn. All of my interests/talents started as a basic curiosity that I needed to learn more about. One thing I started early on was playing music. While watching a band play at church, I found myself captivated by the drummer. Before this time I had never really watched a band live before. I studied what the drummer was doing as the band was playing and told myself "I can do that!" Sure enough, one week later I asked a friend if I could play his drumset and I was already playing the same beat I saw performed.

                        Ive been interested in technology since I was young, and having family members in the tech field made it easier for me to choose what I wanted to do. I started working for my brothers web development company when I was 13 as a Social Media Manager, and left when I turned 17 to focus on school. Im excited to get back into it and learn everything about programming!
